# WorkoutExport

WorkoutExport is an iOS app designed to help users view and export workout data, including altitude graphs and map views. The app provides a clean interface for exploring workout details, visualizing routes, and exporting your workout data for use in other applications.

   - Share your workout routes with friends or coaches
   - Import your activities into other fitness or mapping apps (such as Strava, Google Earth, or Garmin Connect)
   - Back up your workout data for future use
   - Visualize your routes in 3D or on different map platforms
- View detailed workout information
- Interactive map view of workout routes
- Altitude graph visualization
- Modern SwiftUI interface


## How Export Works
1. Select a workout from your list.
2. Tap the export button.
3. Choose your preferred format: GPX (for GPS data and compatibility) or KML (for Google Earth and rich map visualization).
4. Save the file locally, share it, or open it in another app.
